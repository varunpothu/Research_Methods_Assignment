President Donald Trump\\u2019s tenure lasted just four years, but in that time he dragged policy on an array of key issues in a dramatic new direction. Joe Biden\\u2019s victory, confirmed by the Associated Press late morning on Nov. 7, presents an opportunity to reset the White House agenda and put it on a different course. Three scholars discuss what a Biden presidency may have in store in three key areas: race, the Supreme Court and foreign policy. Brian Purnell, Bowdoin CollegeThe next four years under a Biden administration will likely see improvements in racial justice. But to many, it will be a low bar to clear: President Donald Trump downplayed racist violence, egged on right wing extremists and described Black Lives Matter as a \\u201csymbol of hate\\u201d during his four year tenure. Indeed, according to polls, most Americans agree that race relations have deteriorated under Trump. Still, Biden is in some ways an unlikely president to advance a progressive racial agenda. In the 1970s, he opposed busing plans and stymied school desegregation efforts in Delaware, his home state. And in the mid 1990s he championed a federal crime bill that made incarceration rates for Black people worse. He bungled the hearings that brought Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court by allowing Republican senators to dismiss Anita Hill\\u2019s damning testimony of Thomas\\u2019 sexual harassment and by failing to allow other Black women to testify. But that was then. During the 2020 campaign, President elect Biden consistently spoke about problems stemming from systemic racism. Many voters will be hoping that his actions over the next four years must match his campaign words. One area that the Biden administration will surely address is policing and racial justice. The Justice Department can bring accountability to police reform by returning to practices the Obama administration put in place to monitor and reform police departments, such as the use of consent degrees. More difficult reforms require redressing how mass incarceration caused widespread voter disenfranchisement in Black American and Latino communities. \\u201cMy administration will incentivize states to automatically restore voting rights for individuals convicted of felonies once they have served their sentences,\\u201d Biden told The Washington Post. The killing of George Floyd earlier this year reinvigorated talk of addressing systemic racial discrimination through fundamental changes in how police departments hold officers accountable for misconduct and excessive force. It is unclear how far President elect Biden will walk down this road. But evoking the words of the late civil rights icon and Congressman John Lewis, he at least suggested at the Democratic National Convention that America was ready to do the hard work of \\u201crooting out systemic racism. \\u201dBiden can help address how Americans think about and deal with unexamined racial biases through reversing the previous administration\\u2019s executive order banning anti racism training and workshops. In so doing, Biden can build on psychological research on bias to make American workplaces, schools and government agencies equitable, just places. \",\n          \" My hearing loss had been a millstone that I carried alone. Once technology allowed me to hear more, I could share my burden. There is a hard lesson I have learned: trying to hide a disability comes with a painfully high cost. I grew up with a serious hearing loss, bluffing and pretending to hear. Then, as now, there was a stigma attached to my deafness: it implied that you were not too bright, doddering if aged, not worth talking to, someone to avoid. Because it is an invisible disability, those with a hearing loss often try to hide it. But my lesson applies to those with more visible disabilities as well. After I started wearing a hearing aid at the age of 11, I self consciously hid it under long thick hair. I did not discuss my disability; I did not ask for accommodations, even when I went to York University in Toronto, for there were none. I did not advocate on my own behalf and didn\\u2019t even know how to. Instead, I kept my head down. I over compensated. I faked it. This all changed when I learned to hear with cochlear implants, surgically implanted devices that stimulate my hearing nerves directly. It was then that I slowly became aware of the cost of trying to hide my disability. People were interested in my new bionic hearing in a way that they had never been interested in my boring old hearing aids. Colleagues at work wondered what kind of digital processing chip my device had. \\u201cIs it a pentium chip?\\u201d one asked. Instead of something to hide and be ashamed of, my hearing loss and my admittedly imperfect \\u2013 but improving \\u2013 ability to understand speech, birdsong, even symphonies with my new technology became a point of pride. In the early days after receiving my implants, I was constantly recruiting hearing people to help explain the strange noises I heard with my cochlear implants. The buzzing noise I heard at work? The fluorescent lights. The whooshing sound outside? The wind in the trees. Whereas my hearing loss had been a disability that I carried on my own shoulders, alone, ironically once I could hear more, I could share its burden. Friends, family and acquaintances were willing to share the load; they were curious about this loss, this technology, this ability to hear with mere electrodes zapping the nerves of my inner ear. They were prepared to help me interpret the strange sounds I heard, prepared to believe that someone deaf was worth talking to. I used to pretend that I could hear, smiling at jokes for which I did not catch the punch line \\u2013 because to stop the conversation and say, \\u201cpardon,\\u201d aside from ruining a good joke, was often of no avail because I would still not understand. And then, I would feel guilty at the wasted good will of the person patiently repeating what was said. I hid my disability rather than shared it. But now, with my new bionic hearing, I had a fighting chance! I could ask for a repeat and hear it. And the repeats were not needed as often. I have so much more sound information to work with than I had when I used my old hearing aids. Now, there is no need to fake it because I am open about my hearing loss . I am unashamed. Ironically, when my hearing improved, I understood better how to live with a disability. I understood that there is no need to hide it for it was the hiding of my disability and not my disability itself that made me appear foolish and not too bright. The cost of not advocating for my needs and trying to hide my disability had been my authenticity. Where previously I had been bluffing, inauthentic and closeted, now I have come out of the closet of deafness and become more authentic. I have slowly learned to ask for the accommodations that I need. This is part of the lesson that all persons with a disability, young and old, with visible and invisible disabilities, need to learn. No matter what the disability or it\\u2019s extent, it is neither something to hide, nor yours alone to bear. \",\n          \"Colorados newest attempt at police reform is so subtle, youd have to know what youre looking for to see it. For the second time in three years, lawmakers will consider adding a symbol to state issued IDs that indicate the person has a disability. The bill, HB21 1014, would also allow for a computer notation on a persons license plate record, so that if law enforcement were to run the plate, they would know that the driver or passenger has a disability. Not a physical disability. Ultimately, starting the conversation with our law enforcement that approaching somebody with an invisible disability has to be done from a different perspective, said State Rep. Dafna Michaelson Jenet, D Commerce City. Invisible disabilities can include autism, deafness, ADHD, something that could impair an interaction with law enforcement. This is a way to very clearly, very easily, very quickly communicate, there is something different about the way I operate, so you have to pause and lets figure out how we work together, said Michaelson Jenet. RELATED: Denver City Council approves additional COVID 19 relief, housing : This will result in a culture change: Independent panel to investigate sexual harassment claims in Colorado Judicial branchLawmakers in Alaska passed this type of bill in 2017. It creates a symbol, the letter I, to be used on state issued IDs to indicate someone has an invisible disability. If you are going to stop someone on the street and ask for their identification, if you have that symbol that you have voluntarily opted in, it is a starting point for a conversation about what is different about me, said Michaelson Jenet. She first attempted this bill in 2019, but it didnt make it out of the first committee. This came from a student from Littleton High School, Rebecca Zickerman, when she was in high school, as a student with Cerebral Palsy. She was afraid that if she got pulled over, she might have jerky behaviors that could cause an officer to interact with her inappropriately, said Michaelson Jenet. That version of the bill required that a person provide a form signed from a physician or psychiatrist or other medical professional to qualify for the disability symbol. This year, that is not included in the bill. We worked very closely with the disability community, and the number one reason that were not requiring medical personnel to sign off is because medical personnel dont always identity the invisible disability, said Michaelson Jenet. Alaskas law also requires training for law enforcement, as well as an addition to the states driver handbook to include driver\\u2019s obligations when they are stopped by an officer. Michaelson Jenets bill does neither, but a companion bill handles the training aspect. Its purposeful that theyre separate, but they also are driving down the highway in parallel lanes in trying to get to the same place, said State Rep. Meg Froelich, D Englewood. Froelich is the sponsor of HB21 1122, which creates a 10 person commission to recommend new training guidelines to be considered by the peace officer standards and training board . The recommendations for new training for law enforcement and first responders would be due by July 2022. The hope is, with training they go through a, sort of, checklist; is this person not complying with what Ive asked them to do because of these reasons that are perfectly legitimate and not about defiance, said Froelich. The idea of our bill is not to just simply say to the police academies, you need to do a better job on training people for interactions with folks with disabilities, it is to bring the disability community to the table. The commission would include two people with disabilities and two parents of a child with a disability. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Basis\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          3,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"URL\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 479,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathankaufman/2021/12/17/mindset-matters-reframing-entrepreneurship-and-disability-to-shape-a-new-business-culture/?sh=2823b43c774f\",\n          \"https://theconversation.com/incels-are-surprisingly-diverse-but-united-by-hate-163414\",\n          \"https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2022/05/09/supreme-court-decision-weakens-disability-rights-advocates-say/29843/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true,\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Unnamed: 6\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": 156.0,\n        \"max\": 156.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          156.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
